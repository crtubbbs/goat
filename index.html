                <p>For the past few years there has been a big argument in between fans in the NBA community. Many people have 
                    different views about who the greatest player of all time is and why they are. The main people that come 
                    up are Michael Jordan, Lebron James, and Kobe Bryant. In this website I will give my own 
                    opinion and stats from the main contenders so you can make one for yourself as well. I have been an NBA fan my whole 
                    life and have studied it as well as have had many debates with others that are interested in the NBA. As you will find 
                    there are many different factors that you need to consider before you can truly pick who the best of all time is.
