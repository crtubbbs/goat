                <p id = "p-mj">The most current player to be considered the greatest of all time is Lebron James. He is currently playing and 
                    up to this point has played 20 years. His career avergaes are 25.8pts 7.5rbs and 7.3asts. He has some of the best raw
                    stats that any player has ever had.
                </p>                 
                <p id = "p-mj2"> Lebron has gone to the finals 10 times and won four of them as well as the finals mvps for each one.
                    He has 4 regular season mvps and although he has never won a defensive player of the year award has 6 defensive team selctions.
                    Currently in his 20 year career he has 18 all star games appearances and is likely to add another this year.
                    Lebron has one of the strongest cases to be the bezt due to his stats and all his finals appearances and longevity.
